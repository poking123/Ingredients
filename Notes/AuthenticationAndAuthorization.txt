- Create an account -> account stored on database (backend)
- User logs in -> Account is authenticated in the backend -> on success, we generate a jwt token and send it to
the frontend to store it in localStorage
- when we send something to the backend, we can authorize with the token (need to send the token)
	- need a verify token function
	- need jwt.verify(req.token, 'secretKey', (err, authData) => {...

- something about protecting routes
